Welcome to my Metric Converter program using JavFX!

Instructions: To use this program, insert one out of the four possible conversions into the Metric Converter window.

The four conversions to choose from are
- km to mile
- kg to lb
- g to oz
- mm to inch

A valid input into the GUI would look like this, "5000 km = mile".

If you input any other conversion besides the ones listed, the GUI program will return a -1 value.

Have fun using this program!
